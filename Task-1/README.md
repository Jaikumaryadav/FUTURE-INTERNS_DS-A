From Raw Data to Strategic Insights – Ecommerce Dashboard in Action! 💼📊
Just wrapped up building an interactive Ecommerce Sales Dashboard combining the strengths of Excel and Power BI – and here's what went into it 👇
🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation in Excel:
Removed duplicates and null values
Standardized fields (dates, names, payment modes)
Created calculated fields for profit and AOV (Average Order Value)
Filtered quarterly data to analyze seasonal trends
📊 Data Visualization in Power BI:
🔥 Visual insights into Sales, Profit, and Quantity trends
🗓️ Monthly Profit tracking with loss visibility (e.g., June & October dips)
🗺️ State-wise performance showing Maharashtra as top performer
📦 Product insights by Category and Sub-Category (Clothing dominates!)
💳 Payment preference breakdown – COD still rules with 44%!
🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Customer-level sales tracking
🎯 Key Metrics Highlighted:
Total Sales: ₹438K+
Profit: ₹37K
Total Quantity Sold: 5615
Avg. Order Value: ₹121K
💡 This project showcases how Excel can be a powerful data prep tool, while Power BI turns numbers into narratives.
✨ Whether you're in analytics, marketing, or operations – dashboards like this help drive better decisions with clarity and speed.
